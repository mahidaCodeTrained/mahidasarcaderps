# MAHIDA'S ARCADE: Rock Paper Scissors

This project is designed to create a fun interactive Rock Paper Scissors game with a fully functioning program that can make it's own choices and possibly best you in a game of chance (Rock Paper Scissors.) Throughout the development of this project from it's inception to it's latest version; the key has always been to demonstrate a complex level of JavaScript through the manipulation of the DOM. The complexity of the JavaScript in this project goes beyond just creating a function for the game to be played... it looks for ways to make the screen more interactible, fun and convenient for the user using the site. 

This page contains a single webpage called :
- index.html / **This webpage contains the Rock Paper Scissors game and all of the elements that are manipulated and used by JavaScript.**

## Features

### Future Features

- In the future there are definelty many ways for me to return to this project and create more complexity and improve on the nature of the interactiability.
- For example, I would like to add more transitions and manipulate the DOM on certain elements to add highly detailed animations.
- I would like to add a home page that is detailed and has it's own identity so it doesn't feel like just any Rock Paper Scissors game.




## User Stories
1. As a new user, I want to be able to play a functioning game of Rock, Paper Scissors.
2. As a new user, I want to know the rules behind playing Rock Paper Scissors
3. As a new user, I want to have a chance to replay the game if I wanted to on the site.
4. As a new user, I want to know why I won and why the computer has lost with our options displayed.
5. As a new user, I want to have a summary so I can check exactly what rounds I won or lost or what rounds were drawn?
6. As a new user, I want there to be a difference in the display of the site whether or not I win or lose.



## UX
[Include information about the user experience aspects of your project]
- The design for this project started through wireframing and viewing material that is focused on making interactive JavaScript projects. 
- The wireframing of this project, helped me create the base structure of the site with the header being everpresent and the footer element to give the website a professional look.
- The stylistic apporach to this project was planned ahead of time before the projects inception period. The goal was to make a program-esque aestethic with the use of color and very specifically the font used for the project.
- The navigation was going to be non-existent for the page as it is just a Rock Paper Scissors game on a single page. The header therefore needed something to occupy the plethora of space within it. A button was used to display hidden content crucial to the game and UX.

### Color Scheme 
- The use of color in this project with all honesty, wasn't intended to be a focal point. The idea behind the project initially was to have a "program-esque" look akin to common depictions of code with the colors black and white. However, through working and developing the project and the elements within it, that thought regressed and color slowly oozed it's way into the project. 
- The use of color in this project is quite minimal but effective in both it's style and within the user experience that goes behind setting the color as intended which will be explained below. 
- Although, color was minimal it can commonaly be seen used to create a division in elements, a division in sides, a division in choices and a divison in score.
- The colors that were used are:-

- `black` this color was used to create that oldschool program look for the Rock Paper Scissors game. It was intended to make it feel and breath "retro".

- `green` this color was specifically used to create a division between the player/user and the computer. The color green is normally is signified in motifs of self and ownership. This provided a stark contrast between the other color selected to signify the other end of the division; the computer.

- `red` this color as stated signifies the divison between the player and computer. The color red normally is showcased as a color of opposition, uncertainty and danger which is why it was used to create this battle ground visage that can be seen in the scoreboard with the player used having the color green on their side whilst the computer used a blood red showcasing it's an enemy that you need to defeat in "Mahida's Arcade Rock, Paper, Scissors.".


I used the website [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/7f0ffb-c27b6f-9ecffa-fafafa-000000) to generate the color pallete.

### Typography 

- This project uses only one font and that is "monospace". This was a creative decision to give the screen once again a "program-esque" look to it. Additionally, it helps sell the idea of "Mahida's Arcade" as the font itself feels extremely arcade like due to the use of spacing between the letters akin to an old school game or a computer terminal. 
- In additon, the font is extremely clear to read as the spacing gives letters much more room to breathe allowing users to better follow the text content in a quicker more sophisticated manner.
